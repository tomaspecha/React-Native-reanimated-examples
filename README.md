Reanimated Examples in React Native
This project demonstrates a variety of animation techniques using the React Native Reanimated library. Each component showcases unique interactive and visually engaging animations to enhance the user interface of React Native applications. Below is an overview of how the Reanimated library is leveraged in this project.

Components and Animation Techniques
1. TileScroll
Purpose: Smooth horizontal scrolling with dynamic tile transitions.
Key Features:

Uses useSharedValue to track the scroll position.
useAnimatedScrollHandler captures scroll events and updates shared values.
Dynamic scaling and translation effects are achieved using useAnimatedStyle.
Background color transitions are created using interpolateColor.
2. ZoomIn
Purpose: Zoom-in animation for images or views.
Key Features:

useSharedValue controls the scale of the target element.
Scale values are smoothly updated using withSpring for a natural effect.
Zooming is applied through useAnimatedStyle.
3. Counter
Purpose: Animated number increment feature.
Key Features:

Current count is stored in useSharedValue and updated with withTiming.
Numbers are animated and displayed using Animated.Text.
4. PanHandlerMove
Purpose: Draggable elements that follow touch gestures.
Key Features:

Gesture tracking with useAnimatedGestureHandler updates translateX and translateY.
Smooth transitions during drag-and-drop interactions are achieved with withSpring.
Dragged elements dynamically update styles via useAnimatedStyle.
5. CollapsibleHeader
Purpose: Collapsing header that adjusts as the user scrolls.
Key Features:

Scroll position is monitored with useAnimatedScrollHandler.
Header height and opacity dynamically change using interpolate.
Collapsing and expanding effects are smoothed using withTiming.
6. Swiper
Purpose: Swipeable cards with animated transitions.
Key Features:

Each card's position is tracked with useSharedValue.
Swipe gestures are handled by useAnimatedGestureHandler.
Card transitions, such as swiping out or resetting position, are animated with withSpring.
7. Scrolling
Purpose: Animated scroll effects like parallax or fade-in elements.
Key Features:

Scroll position is tracked with useAnimatedScrollHandler.
Element properties like opacity and scale adjust dynamically using interpolate.
8. formReanimated
Purpose: Animated transitions for form elements.
Key Features:

Input fields and buttons scale, fade, or slide into view using useAnimatedStyle.
Interactive effects are enhanced with withSpring or withTiming.
9. ToggleButton
Purpose: Smooth animated toggle switch.
Key Features:

useSharedValue tracks the toggle state.
Knob position and background color transition dynamically with useAnimatedStyle and interpolate.
10. Other Components
SwiperPagerButton, TrackStatus, AnimatedPics, SwipableList, SlideToReturn, AnimatedText:
These components use a mix of gesture handling, shared values, and dynamic styles to create interactive features like swipe-to-dismiss lists, animated text transitions, and image carousels.

Key Reanimated Features Used
useSharedValue: Tracks and shares values across animations.
useAnimatedStyle: Dynamically computes styles based on shared values.
useAnimatedScrollHandler: Monitors scroll events for scroll-based animations.
useAnimatedGestureHandler: Handles gesture-based interactions like dragging or swiping.
Animation Functions:
withSpring: For bouncy, natural animations.
withTiming: For smooth, time-based transitions.
interpolate & interpolateColor: Maps input values (e.g., scroll position) to output ranges (e.g., scale, opacity, colors).
Usage
This project is a great resource for learning how to implement interactive animations in React Native applications using the Reanimated library. Each component is designed to be modular and reusable, providing practical examples for developers.
